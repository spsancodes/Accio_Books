# ACCIO BOOKS - Magical Library System



**ACCIO! BOOKS** is a Harry-potter-themed online library system that brings the enchanting world of literature to life. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project aims to provide an immersive and user-friendly platform for browsing books with magical effects.

Traditional library systems often lack engaging user interfaces and are mainly focused on cataloging books without offering much interaction. ACCIO BOOKS aims to address this by incorporating a magical theme to enhance the user experience.

**ACCIO** is a latin word meaning, "I call" or " I summon".
